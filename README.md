# Bikesharing
## Overview of the Analysis
Citibike is a useful resource for those living and visiting New York City. 2 entrepreneurs traveled to New York City. During their trip they almost exculsively used Citibike as a means of transportation. This analysis will be used to show some details of this program in New York City. The data for the analysis is from August 2019. The goal of the entrepreneurs is to build a similar but scaled program in Des Moines Iowa.

For Des Moines a suggestion would be in the downtown district as a similar place to start. 

Some bikes can get heavy utilization while others do not get used as often. Placement of the bikes for maximum use will be important.

## Summary
While there are significant difffernces in the populations of New York City and Des Moines Iowa there is data that can help better inform the investors of the possiblities of creating a Citibike for Des Moines. Additional analysis would be needed. Suggestions for improvement would be to gather statistics on population in the highest use areas of New York City and identify similar areas of Des Moines. Analysis could show the popuation by gender for New York and Des Moines. Is there a similar breakdown? Is there a similar breakdown in the purposed bike location areas? What is the number of jobs in the high use areas? This could also be a beneficial analysis.
